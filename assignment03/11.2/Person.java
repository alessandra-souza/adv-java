// 11.2 (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a
// class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
// Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee.

// A person has a name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
// A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant.
// An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming
// Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired.
// A faculty member has office hours and a rank.
// A staff member has a title.

// Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.

// Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. 
// Write a test program that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, 
// and invokes their toString() methods.
